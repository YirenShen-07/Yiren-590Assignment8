Meanwhile, on the right side of the figure, there are some words with a more scattered distribution, which indicates that the representation of these words in the embedding space is different from that of the main cluster, with unique characteristics or different semantic relations.\n",

        "- Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP regarding embedding space visualization. The output of pCA presents most words in a dense region-smooth overall structure; yet, it cannot separate the semantic groups well. While t-SNE is much better to highlight the local structure, showing more pronounced clustering between words, the labels are too seriously overlapped, making reading less readable. uMAP is more decentralized, since there are several distinct clusters, with dense clusters towards the right, which are isolated to the bottom left. This means that it has a better balance between global and local structure preservation, though the tags still overlap.\n",
        "- PCA is proper for viewing overall pattern distribution, t-SNE shows better local relationships and proximity, while UMAP balances the local and global structure better. To get better visualization, it may be effectively improved by decreasing the sample size or adopting an interactive visualization tool. Taking all the above together, the present analysis illustrates that UMAP actually conveys richer semantic structure, while t-SNE might be more applicable to in-depth analysis of the local patterns."
